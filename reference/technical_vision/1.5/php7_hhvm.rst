PHP7 and HHVM
=============

We continue to do several compatibility tests for PHP7 and HHVM.

Our dependencies are becoming more and more compliant and our Continuous integration is configured to run our unit tests suites with PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0 and HHVM.

Akeneo PIM is still not production ready with PHP7 and HHVM but we're definitely getting closer.
